					<p>Whether due to an environment of systematic underinvestment in technology, successive investments in different platforms and technologies, or growth through acquisition, most publishers are facing a variety of technology challenges. At Treadwell Media Group our perspective is that effective technology management starts with a strong technology management base upon which an evolving digital toolkit of cloud, social, analytics, mobile and rich media is used to drive rapid customer-facing innovation and internally-facing scalability and business efficiency.</p>
					<p>Modern customer-facing products and platforms require rapid rollout of features and capabilities driven by strong product management and architectural discipline paired with agile development processes. Reconciliation of often-conflicting and rapidly changing priorities in a fast-paced and evolving technology environment are the biggest challenges, particularly as these new demands apply pressure to longer-cycle and more traditional editorial processes.</p>
					<p>In internally-facing, non-product applications, this focus on innovation and agility shifts toward an emphasis on enabling business productivity via carefully defined and managed IT services. Internal priorities are set in consultation with operating executives to determine which services will drive the greatest business value. These are then designed and implemented in a controlled operations management environment on a defined technology stack.</p>
					<p>Whatever your technology management challenges:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Product platform rationalization</li>
						<li>Implementation of agile development technologies in a traditional IT or editorial environment</li>
						<li>Incorporation of mobile, cloud, analytics, social and rich media into customer-facing or internal applications</li>
						<li>Implementation of a disciplined operations management environment</li>
					</ul>
