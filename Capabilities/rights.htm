					<p>Treadwell Media Group provides innovative solutions in capturing information on publishers' largest asset: the rights that they control and exploit. Our solutions include cost-effective capture of rights data from author and subrights contracts and integration of that data into popular rights management services, applications and on-line sales channels.</p>
					<p>By having rights information digitized and readily accessible in a rights management system, publishers achieve a number of direct revenue benefits:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The capture of missed revenue opportunities including unsold sub-rights (beyond the frontlist), renegotiation of expiring deals, and uncollected royalties from deals that have already been negotiated.</li>
						<li>Generating new revenue streams from digital publishing, content recombination, and from electronic rights brokerage exchanges.</li>
						<li>Facilitation of better publishing decisions through go/no-go decisions based not just on anecdotal evidence but also on true understanding of rights sales history of similar titles.</li>
						<li>Increasing margin / reducing write-offs by enabling the targeting of sales efforts to titles with unearned advances.</li>
						<li>Reducing time-to-market in evaluating new revenue opportunities by enabling rapid determination of the rights held.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Beyond the direct revenue benefits of having rights information readily available, capturing contracts in digital form yields substantial productivity, timeliness and business continuation benefits over time. Some of these include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Increasing margin by reducing staff time and effort associated with the management of contracts including indexing, storage and retrieval. These benefits accrue across the organization in legal, rights marketing, editorial, finance, and royalty departments.</li>
						<li>Better disaster recovery - fewer in-process contracts lost, faster speed of recovery and increased ability to store multiple copies in separate remote locations.</li>
						<li>More timely initial entry of data into enterprise systems including royalties, order processing, financial, production, and editorial systems</li>
						<li>Reduction of document management expense associated with storage and retrieval of paper contracts</li>
						<li>More timely response to internal and external inquiries on contract-related issues</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Publishers achieve a number of advantages from the Treadwell Media Group approach:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>High quality, consistent rights data output requiring little intervention for validation</li>
						<li>A cost-effective solution offering quick turnaround on most types of contracts</li>
						<li>Experienced staff with traditional and electronic publishing experience</li>
						<li>Knowledge of functional and data requirements of most rights management systems</li>
						<li>Delivery of rights information to publisher-specified channels of distribution</li>
						<li>Detailed tracking of contract conversion through each stage of production</li>
						<li>Real-time availability of production status via secure web page</li>
						<li>Hassle-free customer service with knowledgeable representatives</li>
						<li>Largest conversion capacity in the industry</li>
						<li>Exceptionally fast ramp-up capability</li>
						<li>Built in disaster recovery through site mirroring and multiple redundant conversion sites</li>
						<li>Global state-of-the-art facilities and telecommunications network</li>
