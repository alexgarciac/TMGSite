					<p>Treadwell Media Group has built its reputation by offering high-quality content conversion and consulting services to publishers entering the eBook space. Now it offers DigitalGalley, a new program that removes costs from the galley and ARC distribution process while simultaneously adding flexibility to it.</p>
					<p>Publishers have long known that the best way to build distribution and then sell-through for a book is through word-of-mouth initiated by "thought" leaders such as reviewers, librarians, and booksellers. It has always been difficult to reach these thought leaders, not only because of the expense of printing and distributing bound galleys and advance reader's copies, but also because these leaders vary by book type and subject; a source well regarded for his/her business book recommendations can't always recommend the latest thriller.</p>
					<p>Treadwell Media Group has recognized this problem, and with the introduction of our DigitalGalley service, 
						<a href="http://www.DigitalGalley.com" target="popup">www.DigitalGalley.com</a>, we have taken the first step toward addressing it. This service delivers digital copies of forthcoming books in many popular formats—including the most popular—Palm Digital Media (formerly Peanut Press). Naturally, this process can be applied to either a selection from a book or a book in its entirety. With DigitalGalley publishers have a low-cost and fast new channel through which they can reach reviewers, librarians and booksellers. For those yet to adopt the new technology, we also offer traditional bound galley production and distribution services.</p>
					<p>DigitalGalley is the first of an anticipated suite of marketing services to come from Treadwell Media Group. During the months ahead we will continue to add services to make book marketing an increasingly painless but fruitful process for publishers.</p>
