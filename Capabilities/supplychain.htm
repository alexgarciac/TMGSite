					<p class="title">Supply Chain and Operations Effectiveness</p>
					<p>With so much attention on digital products and processes, supply chain operations are an often overlooked source of savings, working capital, customer satisfaction and business efficiency. Typically the supply chain will consist of the Order to Cash (OTC) and Procure to Pay (PTP) processes and will encompass well over 50% of P&amp;L cost and balance sheet investment. Frequently observed opportunities include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Supply chain integration via shared forecasts and digital transactions</li>
						<li>Print sourcing optimization including offshore, onshore and print on demand (POD).  This often integrates well with programs to manage printers and paper suppliers more effectively.</li>
						<li>Effective distribution of accurate title metadata</li>
						<li>Tailoring inventory levels to changing print demand via a time-phased sales &amp; operations planning process</li>
						<li>Integration of customer data into print planning and sales operations. This is particularly valuable if there are shifts in channel patterns or title demand is seasonal or unpredictable.</li>
						<li>Use of channel-based print on demand to reduce impact of temporary out-of-stock lost sales</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Treadwell Media Group takes a holistic view of the supply chain starting with the customer service goals of the company including delivery times, fill rates, and flexibility. These translate into structural supply chain decisions...</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Appropriate mix of make-to-stock and make-to-order policies, possibly integrating custom or individualized printing if required by the product strategy</li>
						<li>Inventory deployment to owned and partner facilities, whether third party or wholesale. These decisions are often paired with the company's overall go to market strategy, but can also be considered independently.</li>
						<li>Number, location, and role of distribution facilities along with whether they are owned or outsourced</li>
					</ul>
					<p>...functional decisions...</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Order management
						
							<ul>
								<li>eCommerce integration with traditional credit sales</li>
								<li>Management of channel versus consumer orders</li>
								<li>Reconciliation of traditional order/pack/ship revenue models with sales-report driven revenue and online license, activation and access models</li>
								<li>Rep commission management</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Warehouse management
						
							<ul>
								<li>Receive, pick, pack, ship automation and flow</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Transportation management
						
							<ul>
								<li>Shipment scheduling, consolidation and freight bill audit programs</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Inventory management
						
							<ul>
								<li>Integration of demand forecasts, return forecasts, with inventory planning and optimal print strategy</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>...and supporting organizational elements:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Policy</li>
						<li>Process</li>
						<li>Organization</li>
