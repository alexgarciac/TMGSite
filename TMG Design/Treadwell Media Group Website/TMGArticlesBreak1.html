      <em>Kenneth M Brooks, Jr</em>.</p>
    <p>There has been great progress in e-books and digital content over the last several years, with the introduction of numerous new platforms, formats and channels. Innovative offerings such as those by netLibrary, Questia and ebrary are revolutionizing the way people think about library and reference experiences. Publishers -- and authors such as Stephen King -- are experimenting in greater numbers; even booksellers are getting into the e-publishing game. Other companies, such as Mibrary, are starting to offer solutions to problems that never existed before in the physical book world, by providing consumers with an opportunity to have the same access to their digital purchases that they had to their physical purchases and addressing the many customer service problems that are being introduced into the retail and publishing environments.</p>
    <p>This is all matched by increasing consumer acceptance of e-books as a viable means of reading the titles they are interested in. Mike Segroves, vice-president of marketing of Palm Digital Media (formerly Peanut Press) has commented that his top 50 titles have averaged unit sales of 2000 units per year, and barnesandnoble.com, Microsoft, Gemstar and Adobe are all continuing to invest significant funds in making e-books a popular reality.</p>
    <p>Finally, along with the experimentation, consolidation is beginning to occur in the offerings, standards and business models. Along with the notable acquisitions of NuvoMedia and Softbook Press by Gemstar and the acquisition of Glassbook by Adobe, there has been substantial progress on the standards front with the introduction of the first Open E-Book (OEB) release, soon to be joined by version 2.0. Along with this progress there have been some notable casualties, companies going out of business or dramatically changing their business model. Examples include Bookface, Everybook, Librius and iBooks.</p>
