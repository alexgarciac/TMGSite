      <em>Kenneth M Brooks, Jr</em>.</p>
    <p><span class="term">Outstanding issues</span></p>
    <p>In spite of this progress there are still issues outstanding, most notably acceptance of e-books by the mass market. It is still rare to find individuals who have read entire novels or regularly refer to online or e-book reference works. This reality has many causes that will be addressed in this chapter, primary of which are barriers to use in the platforms themselves, including impenetrable Digital Rights Management (DRM) solutions, usability, screen readability, battery life, price -- basically e-books still aren't as easy to use as printed books (p-books).</p>
    <p>This lack of popularity of e-books is not present among technologically sophisticated 'early adopters'. In this population one sees increasing evidence that when they can't find a title that they want at a reasonable price within legitimate distribution channels, the community will band together on Usenet, Napster, and Bookwarez to exchange and distribute pirate e-book editions of titles that have never been offered as e-books by the publisher.</p>
    <p>Publishing is at its heart a business of slow-moving items. The number of titles that are published every year is significant: over 50,000 in US consumer publishing alone. On average these titles don't sell very well, limiting the amount of money that can be spent on marketing. Further, once published, these titles don't individually move very quickly at retail and the customer base for any particular title is quite diffuse.</p>
    <p>A final issue that impacts the speed with which e-books are accepted -- and the mismatch in expectations within the media and industry -- is that the technology view of how publishing works (or perhaps should work) is quite different from the way it actually works. A technologist will blithely talk about the authoring process or the availability of electronic files without realizing that, for a traditional publisher, this is a complex process, involving one or more translations of the title's content from an electronic file to paper and back again. This may not result in an electronic file that matches the printed edition; if it does, the file may not be traceable.</p>
