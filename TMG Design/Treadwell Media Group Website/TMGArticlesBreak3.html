    <p class="term">Awareness</p>
    <p>The final issue is the extent to which consumers are aware that titles they seek are available as e-books. A publisher can have great content that's available at a low price, but in order to get a sale, consumers must be aware that it is available. With the limited installed base of reading platforms, this presently involves more platform marketing that content marketing. Given the cost of a marketing program and the breadth of formats in which a consumer may want any particular title, it is likely that publishers will never find it cost-effective to market a particular format, but will rather focus their attention on the title as a whole across all of the formats in which it is available for sale.</p>
    <p>For now I would suggest that because the mass market doesn't know about platforms, the content or how to find e-books, there needs to be a long-term effort in 'cooperative marketing' where there is cross-promotion of devices, content and channels.<br />
      Conclusion</p>
    <p>The five key constraints on the speed of development of the e-book market are platforms, content, availability, price and awareness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Platforms -- without an installed base of reading platforms, there won't be e-book sales. This represents an upper boundary on all of the rest of the drivers.</li>
      <li>Content -- without appropriate content for the readers with the platforms there also won't be e-book sales. Further, if the content is in the wrong format, it won't be usable on reading platforms in widespread use.</li>
      <li>Availability -- if a reader can't find it, he can't buy it. Where do readers go to buy e-books and how do the e-books get there?</li>
      <li>Price -- how much will a reader pay when it's all said and done?</li>
      <li>Awareness -- even if the best content is available at reasonable price, if the reader doesn't know about it, he won't purchase the title.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Publishers must be well represented in popular channels with all of their content. If consumers can't find what they want through legitimate channels, they may very well be motivated to find the titles elsewhere -- or even to distribute them themselves. The question is which will happen first: Napster for e-books, or e-books available legitimately.</p>
    <p>By taking appropriate steps, publishers will put themselves in the best position to profit from this new world of e-books and digital distribution. The time to move is now, before we end up in the same mess the music industry has with MP3. This market is moving and we can make the choice for ourselves to be part of the steamroller or part of the road.</p>
