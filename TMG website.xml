			<bold>The Challenge</bold>
		</para>
		<para>These days publishers face questions in many areas where process has formerly been defined by time tested methods and experience. Some of those questions are:</para>
		<bulletList>
			<listItem>How can the digital transition be managed while maintaining print output?</listItem>
			<listItem>	How can new technologies including agile, cloud, social and mobile be integrated into products and internal processes?</listItem>

			<listItem>How can financial performance be improved in key areas of operations: inventory, backorders, obsolescence, plant cost, operating expense?</listItem>
			<listItem>	How can metrics be used to link operational performance to business results? Are there other opportunities to use advanced analytics to improve business performance?</listItem>
			<listItem>How does one go about retooling the workforce in order to create engaging digital products from a classic print-centric organization?</listItem>
			<listItem>What role should "agile" play in product development and editorial processes?  In platform development? In infrastructure technology?</listItem>

			<serviceLineDescription>
				<para>Publishers are encountering the need to evolve their product strategies to increasingly consider digital offerings, changing customer needs and expectations, and increasing competitive pressures from both existing players and new market entrants. These trends are increasing the pressure on existing product development processes:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Increasing number of products in increasing formats, often with decreasing units per format</listItem>
					<listItem>Need for reduced time-to-market and ability to rapidly incorporate market feedback in offerings</listItem>
					<listItem>Need to increase discoverability and relevance to potential readers/customers</listItem>
					<listItem>Need to synchronize product delivery with marketing, sales, distribution and post-sale support processes</listItem>
					<listItem>Need to customize and individualize title offerings</listItem>
					<listItem>Need to integrate technology into products whether useful tools, interactivity or rich media</listItem>
					<listItem>Integration with platforms: publisher proprietary and those of channel partners</listItem>
				</unOrderedList>
				<para>As each new product is introduced, it is generally accompanied by its own development process, creating a situation where activities are fragmented, unpredictable and in general yield insufficient scale for maximum effectiveness, regardless of whether effectiveness is defined by cost, speed, capacity or flexibility.</para>
				<para>At Treadwell Media Group we've lived through these challenges and have implemented processes, organization and technology to relieve the pain.  While there is no panacea, all solutions will have one or more key elements:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Differentiation in customer-facing offerings.</listItem>
					<listItem>Scalable platforms behind the scenes for editorial, production, content management and rights management functions.</listItem>
					<listItem>Alignment with the product strategy whether the introduction of a few, highly-differentiated products, or a large number of low cost titles.</listItem>
					<listItem>Alignment and coordination of centralized functions with product needs via workflow and planning tools.</listItem>
					<listItem>Standards where they're invisible, differentiation where they're not.</listItem>
					<listItem>Ability to quickly and easily re-use content where appropriate.</listItem>
					<listItem>Synchronized delivery of all output and intermediate formats via continuous integration, "XML-first" and other process automation.</listItem>
					<listItem>Synchronized and consistent design across all output formats and devices via responsive design techniques.</listItem>
					<listItem>Direct feedback loops on product usage, competitor offerings and social trends straight into the product development teams.</listItem>

			<serviceLineDescription>
				<para>With so much attention on digital products and processes, supply chain operations are an often overlooked source of savings, working capital, customer satisfaction and business efficiency. Typically the supply chain will consist of the Order to Cash (OTC) and Procure to Pay (PTP) processes and will encompass well over 50% of P&amp;L cost and balance sheet investment. Frequently observed opportunities include:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Supply chain integration via shared forecasts and digital transactions</listItem>
					<listItem>Print sourcing optimization including offshore, onshore and print on demand (POD).  This often integrates well with programs to manage printers and paper suppliers more effectively.</listItem>
					<listItem>Effective distribution of accurate title metadata</listItem>
					<listItem>Tailoring inventory levels to changing print demand via a time-phased sales &amp; operations planning process</listItem>
					<listItem>Integration of customer data into print planning and sales operations. This is particularly valuable if there are shifts in channel patterns or title demand is seasonal or unpredictable.</listItem>
					<listItem>Use of channel-based print on demand to reduce impact of temporary out-of-stock lost sales</listItem>

			<masterServiceLineName>Outsourcing and Vendor Management</masterServiceLineName>
			<serviceLineDescription>
				<para>Establishing and effectively managing third party relationships is a key element in extending the reach and capabilities of a publishing enterprise and managing an uneven flow of work over the course of time. It allows use of specialized expertise as needed and reduces the effective cost of operations. At the same time there are legal risks associated with excessive or improper use of freelancers, and commonly accepted practices may not yield the innovative results necessary for success today.</para>
				<para>At Treadwell Media Group we take a category approach to vendor management, looking at each type of good or service in terms of its importance to the business and the difficulty of the particular market. We extract and consolidate the expectations of the management team in each category in terms of time, quality and cost performance, and consolidate them with our experience and best practice. These expectations then lead to the optimal vendor strategy by category:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Strategic partnerships</listItem>
					<listItem>Blanket contracts</listItem>
					<listItem>Scales-based purchasing</listItem>
					<listItem>Spot purchasing</listItem>
				</unOrderedList>
				<para>We have found that for many critical categories in product development and supply chain operations, developing strategic partnerships and consolidating volume into these partnerships can result in significant cost reduction and decreased time to market. Other possibilities include:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Outsourcing / nearshoring / offshoring</listItem>
					<listItem>Vendor consolidation</listItem>
					<listItem>Independent contractor / freelancer program consolidation</listItem>
					<listItem>Consolidation of services across multiple related categories into full service suppliers</listItem>
					<listItem>Directed buy programs</listItem>
				</unOrderedList>
				<para>Once a vendor management strategy has been identified we then can assist in executing Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP) processes and negotiating Master Service Agreement (MSA) or Statement of Work (SOW) contracts. This will often lead to supply chain integration activities such as sharing forecasts of upcoming work and using EDI / XBITS to facilitate transactions.</para>

			<serviceLineDescription>
				<para>Whether due to an environment of systematic underinvestment in technology, successive investments in different platforms and technologies, or growth through acquisition, most publishers are facing a variety of technology challenges. At Treadwell Media Group our perspective is that effective technology management starts with a strong technology management base upon which an evolving digital toolkit of cloud, social, analytics, mobile and rich media is used to drive rapid customer-facing innovation and internally-facing scalability and business efficiency.</para>
				<para>Modern customer-facing products and platforms require rapid rollout of features and capabilities driven by strong product management and architectural discipline paired with agile development processes. Reconciliation of often-conflicting and rapidly changing priorities in a fast-paced and evolving technology environment are the biggest challenges, particularly as these new demands apply pressure to longer-cycle and more traditional editorial processes.</para>
				<para>In internally-facing, non-product applications, this focus on innovation and agility shifts toward an emphasis on enabling business productivity via carefully defined and managed IT services. Internal priorities are set in consultation with operating executives to determine which services will drive the greatest business value. These are then designed and implemented in a controlled operations management environment on a defined technology stack.</para>
				<para>Whatever your technology management challenges:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Product platform rationalization</listItem>
					<listItem>Implementation of agile development technologies in a traditional IT or editorial environment</listItem>
					<listItem>Incorporation of mobile, cloud, analytics, social and rich media into customer-facing or internal applications</listItem>
					<listItem>Implementation of a disciplined operations management environment</listItem>

			<masterServiceLineName>Rights Conversion Services</masterServiceLineName>
			<serviceLineDescription>
				<para>Treadwell Media Group provides innovative solutions in capturing information on publishers' largest asset: the rights that they control and exploit. Our solutions include cost-effective capture of rights data from author and subrights contracts and integration of that data into popular rights management services, applications and on-line sales channels.</para>
				<para>By having rights information digitized and readily accessible in a rights management system, publishers achieve a number of direct revenue benefits:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>The capture of missed revenue opportunities including unsold sub-rights (beyond the frontlist), renegotiation of expiring deals, and uncollected royalties from deals that have already been negotiated.</listItem>
					<listItem>Generating new revenue streams from digital publishing, content recombination, and from electronic rights brokerage exchanges.</listItem>
					<listItem>Facilitation of better publishing decisions through go/no-go decisions based not just on anecdotal evidence but also on true understanding of rights sales history of similar titles.</listItem>
					<listItem>Increasing margin / reducing write-offs by enabling the targeting of sales efforts to titles with unearned advances.</listItem>
					<listItem>Reducing time-to-market in evaluating new revenue opportunities by enabling rapid determination of the rights held.</listItem>
				</unOrderedList>
				<para>Beyond the direct revenue benefits of having rights information readily available, capturing contracts in digital form yields substantial productivity, timeliness and business continuation benefits over time. Some of these include:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>Increasing margin by reducing staff time and effort associated with the management of contracts including indexing, storage and retrieval. These benefits accrue across the organization in legal, rights marketing, editorial, finance, and royalty departments.</listItem>
					<listItem>Better disaster recovery - fewer in-process contracts lost, faster speed of recovery and increased ability to store multiple copies in separate remote locations.</listItem>
					<listItem>More timely initial entry of data into enterprise systems including royalties, order processing, financial, production, and editorial systems</listItem>
					<listItem>Reduction of document management expense associated with storage and retrieval of paper contracts</listItem>
					<listItem>More timely response to internal and external inquiries on contract-related issues</listItem>
				</unOrderedList>
				<para>Publishers achieve a number of advantages from the Treadwell Media Group approach:</para>
				<unOrderedList>
					<listItem>High quality, consistent rights data output requiring little intervention for validation</listItem>
					<listItem>A cost-effective solution offering quick turnaround on most types of contracts</listItem>
					<listItem>Experienced staff with traditional and electronic publishing experience</listItem>
					<listItem>Knowledge of functional and data requirements of most rights management systems</listItem>
					<listItem>Delivery of rights information to publisher-specified channels of distribution</listItem>
					<listItem>Detailed tracking of contract conversion through each stage of production</listItem>
					<listItem>Real-time availability of production status via secure web page</listItem>
					<listItem>Hassle-free customer service with knowledgeable representatives</listItem>
					<listItem>Largest conversion capacity in the industry</listItem>
					<listItem>Exceptionally fast ramp-up capability</listItem>
					<listItem>Built in disaster recovery through site mirroring and multiple redundant conversion sites</listItem>
					<listItem>Global state-of-the-art facilities and telecommunications network</listItem>
