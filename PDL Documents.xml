From the very beginning, it is clear that the relationship between the writer and Chloe is no ordinary one. The letters describe a liaison governed by power; a liaison which transforms an innocent young woman into a powerful sexual enigma. Each letter pushes Chloe a little closer to the limits of sexual role-play, testing her obedience, her willingness to explore ever more extreme taboos. Until, as events reach their climax, the question must be asked; who is really in control.</dc:description>
