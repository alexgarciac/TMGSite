					<p>Print-on-Demand (POD) is an area of publishing 
  where there is potential for significant short-term revenue, but still a good 
  amount of confusion and a number of open issues, particularly in the incipient 
  area of distributed, or &quot;in-store&quot; POD. Distributed POD is showing 
  a great deal of promise in the few locations where it is installed. But there 
  are still questions to be resolved, namely:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What is the consumer experience? How is POD best integrated into the 
  retail shopping experience? Traffic patterns in store are highly variable over 
  the course of a day and a year. What happens to waiting time for a customer's 
  book?</li>
						<li>How good is the quality of reproduction? How necessary and desirable 
  is standardization?</li>
						<li>What are the economics of one-off production? In what circumstances is 
  it feasible?</li>
						<li>Books are low volume merchandise at store level. How big does the digital 
  library need to be to achieve sufficient volume?</li>
						<li>Doesn't central as opposed to in-store POD provide better economics at 
  <i>any</i> scale? Why not use central POD for everything?</li>
						<li>When would it be more effective for publishers to replenish their warehouses 
  using POD than to use either distributor or point-of-sale POD?</li>
						<li>Who pays for the increased cost of production? What's fair?</li>
						<li>How does the book get printed? How is it delivered? How secure is the content?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Economics of Print-on-Demand:  a new cost curve</h3>
					<p>The economics of traditional printing are driven 
  by the length of a print run. As the length goes up, cost per unit comes down. 
  Traditional offset equipment is very expensive, difficult to set up and hard 
  to operate. This leads to a relatively high cost per unit for short print runs 
  &#151; and requires a large team of individuals with very specialized skills &#151; found, 
  naturally, at printers. This high cost of short runs is driven primarily by 
  the set up cost of the press and bindery equipment: changing massive rolls of 
  paper, changing the printing plates on the press, and tinkering with trim and 
  spine size adjustments on the binding line. All of these constitute the cost 
  of make-readies &#151; getting the job ready to run through the machines, not the 
  actual running of the machines themselves.</p>
					<p>With intelligent management, many of the factors 
  that create the steep curve can be minimized in digital printing:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The need for plate changes is entirely eliminated.</li>
						<li>Through good production scheduling and standardization, paper changes 
  can be minimized, as can changes required by different trim sizes.</li>
						<li>Self-adjusting and software-driven trimmers and binders can largely eliminate 
  make-ready effort. Such binders and trimmers exist already and more are under 
  development.</li>
						<li>Workflow integration can eliminate much of the effort of inputting orders, 
  billing, coordinating the production and assembly of the book block and cover, 
  and shipping the title.</li>
					</ul>

					</p>
					<p align="center">
						<b>Figure 1:  The evolving cost curve</b>
					</p>
					<p>The result cost curve is flat &#151; higher for the long run than traditional printing 
  because of toner and paper waste but much cheaper for shorter runs even down 
  to runs as small as one. The equivalency point between POD and traditional printing 
  is about 800 units:  above 800 units, traditional printing is more cost effective 
  and below, print-on-demand is more effective.</p>
					<h3>Volume</h3>
					<p>Volume is also important in digital printing. This is where the distinction 
  between &#147;big iron&#148; POD and &#147;small iron&#148; POD becomes important. &quot;Big iron&quot; 
  POD in these circumstances means POD using equipment such as the IBM InfoPrint 
  4000 and the Xerox Docutech family<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">
							<span> 
  [1] </span>
						</a>. &#147;Small iron&#148; POD is the world of cluster printing and book 
  vending machines. Cluster printing utilizes multiple standard copy machines, 
  both black &amp; white and color, linked together with binding and trimming 
  equipment in a loosely coupled production cell<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
							<span> [2] </span>
						</a>. The book vending machine concept 
  ties these components together tightly using mechanical transport devices &#151; 
  they are often enclosed in a single housing that looks like, well, a book vending 
  machine<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">
							<span> [3] </span>
						</a>!</p>
					<p>Fully-loaded cost per unit under each of these 
  approaches varies considerably with total volume. A big-iron system can go for 
  $3 million fully installed with costs fully allocated, where a small-iron system 
  can go for $40,000 to 60,000. Because the capacities vary so greatly, however, 
  the ultimate fully-allocated cost per unit is lower for the larger equipment 
  when it is fully utilized. The equivalency point between a cluster approach 
  and a big iron approach is in the neighborhood of 10,000 units per month. Below 
  150 books per month no investment in printing equipment at today's prices can 
  really be justified &#151; there just isn't enough revenue from such a low volume 
  to justify the equipment.</p>
					<p>Considering both length of print run and volume 
  per-month a &#147;map&#148; develops showing the combinations of length of print run and 
  monthly volume that lead to selections of the various printing technologies. 
  There are three regions: high print runs require traditional offset to achieve 
  minimum overall cost, regardless of monthly volumes. For lower print runs, lower 
  monthly volume favors small iron POD due to the low investment required and 
  higher volume favors big iron POD to minimize fully allocated cost per unit.</p>

						<b>Figure 2:  Printing Technology Alternatives</b>
					</p>
					<h3>The current title base isn't very exciting.</h3>
					<p>We've seen the importance of volume to overall 
  economics. Volume is a function of the number of titles and the demand at that 
  location. Assuming that there is some sales-based rationale for the selection 
  of exactly which titles are made available in a location, and that retailer, 
  wholesaler and publisher efforts to sell any particular title remain unchanged, 
  the interesting variable is the number of titles that are in a suitable format 
  for POD.</p>
					<p>As of December 2001 there are at most 50,000 titles digitized for POD and the 
  number that have any commercial attractiveness at any level of the supply chain 
  is probably closer to 35,000. This is not terribly exciting at either the wholesale 
  or retail levels. At the wholesale level 20,000 titles was a few month ago generating 
  in the neighborhood of 50,000 units per month in single-copy (as opposed to 
  short-run restocking) orders at Lightning Source through Ingram, the largest 
  book wholesaler in the US. If production is moved to the store level, this aggregating 
  effect breaks down rapidly: the same title base at an <i>average</i> retail 
  location (not a superstore) would result in 10 units per month. This suggests 
  that achieving a reasonable target of 150 units per month would require a title 
  base of 300,000<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">
							<span> [4] </span>
						</a> 
  titles of roughly equivalent commercial appeal to those carried by Lightning 
  Source. This is clearly not practical in the short term, although there are 
  interesting ways to get around this problem by perhaps adding print of local 
  newssheets in a coffee shop environment, or academic course packs in a university 
  bookstore environment. In other words, there are ways to boost the volume being 
  driven through the POD machinery without necessarily having to increase book 
  title availability by a significant amount. </p>
					<h3> So what about service?</h3>
					<p>Beyond volume another key factor in POD adoption 
  is service. Service consists of many factors, but two of them are critical and 
  manageable. They are lead-time &#151; the time from when an order is placed until 
  the book is delivered &#151; and integration with normal customer ordering patterns.</p>
					<p>Long and unpredictable lead-times are two key reasons to stock a title at any 
  level of the supply chain: retail, wholesaler or publisher, versus ordering 
  (or printing) the title when demand materializes.  </p>
					<p>At the retail level this means the unit must 
  be on hand when the customer wants it: it's a widely bandied-about truism in 
  the industry that the overwhelming majority of customers won't approach a bookseller 
  if the book isn't in stock. This lost-sale scenario has its corollary at the 
  wholesaler as well: if the title isn't in stock, the ordering retailer will 
  go elsewhere. The wholesaler faces an added penalty that too great a percentage 
  of non-stocks will cause it to fall in the retailers' shopping sequence, which 
  is often automated by &#147;order cascading&#148; software that is used in most stores. 
  Finally if the title isn't available at the publisher, most retail and wholesale 
  ordering systems are set up to cancel the order.</p>
					<p>Print-on-demand can apparently address this 
  lead-time issue by providing instant (or quick) availability of the title, but 
  solution isn't actually that simple. If capacity on the POD machine isn't managed 
  carefully, a &#147;sequential backlog&#148; problem can develop in which there are so 
  many orders backed up awaiting printing that the lead time grows and grows &#151; 
  just as traffic jams occur during rush hours around bridges and tunnels. If 
  these traffic jams get too severe and lead time lengthens past what the customer 
  has been led to expect, there is a large risk of alienating the customer even 
  more than what would have happened if he'd been told to go elsewhere, or wait 
  a few days, to begin with.</p>
					<p>Another key area of service is how well POD 
  fulfillment is integrated into the ordering patterns at every level of the supply 
  chain.</p>
					<h3>Integration with ordering patterns</h3>
					<p>This effect is most obvious at the retail level where it's important to integrate 
  the printing into the retail shopping experience so that it's not a turn-off 
  for the consumer. Most consumers are accustomed to looking for a book on the 
  shelf, finding it and then going to the checkout line to pay for it. If they 
  don't know the exact book they're looking for, they will browse the bookshelves, 
  select something interesting and again go to the checkout line. Only occasionally 
  will they ask a bookseller for assistance if they can't find a title. This surfaces 
  two problems for distributed POD:  How does a consumer find a book that isn't 
  there? And then, were the consumer to find it, how do they buy the book without 
  significantly extending their time in the store or requiring the bookseller 
  to accept the exposure of carrying a good number of printed, but unclaimed titles? 
</p>
					<p>The first question &#151; that of how to find the 
  title &#151; is usually addressed through some sort of on-line catalog in the store. 
  The larger chains are all experimenting with in-store information kiosks. It 
  would be very easy in such an environment to list POD titles in the kiosk catalog 
  with a notice that they can be printed while the customer waits. It is even 
  better if store inventory is integrated into the kiosk information so that the 
  customer can easily determine if the title is available in the store. Clearly 
  this catalog solution works better in an online retail environment in which 
  the customer already must use the catalog to make selections.</p>
					<p>This brings us to the second problem &#151; integrating 
  purchasing with the remaining items the customer wants. One way to accomplish 
  this is via entry of a credit card number while the customer is still accessing 
  the catalog &#151; similar to a normal shopping cart procedure at an on-line retailer. 
  The book is paid for and starts printing while the customer completes his remaining 
  purchases. This may seem awkward to the customer (he has to present his credit 
  card multiple times) and doesn't work for those customers wishing to pay in 
  cash. The second alternative is to print a receipt at the catalog to be taken 
  to the checkout where the title is paid for. Once the sale has been completed, 
  printing is triggered automatically and the customer is told to either wait 
  for the book to finish (5-10 minutes for most equipment if there is not backlog) 
  or to come back to pick it up. Clearly the book could be sent to the customer 
  if he doesn't want to wait, but that could be more effectively done from a central 
  facility.</p>
					<p>Integration in the wholesaler environment means 
  that the title is shown as &#147;available&#148; when a retailer inquires even if there 
  is no stock currently printed. In the early days of POD there was no status 
  to indicate that the title was available on demand so retailers cancelled orders 
  for which there was not stock on hand at the wholesaler. Ingram addressed this 
  problem at the time by printing several copies of each book carried by Lighting 
  Source and keeping them on the shelves. As the title base grows, however, this 
  solution has become increasingly impractical. It has led to the development 
  of a new inventory code indicating on-demand availability and having both booksellers 
  and bookseller systems aware of what it means. Once such an approach is adopted 
  it becomes a matter of creating a separate zone in the warehouse where orders 
  are directed for printing as opposed to picking. POD titles then join traditional 
  books at the shipping dock for dispatch to the customer.</p>
					<p>At the publisher there are several possible 
  approaches. If the publisher has sufficient volume he may opt to install a POD 
  facility in his warehouse or have one run on-site by a printer offering such 
  services. Units can then be either printed in response to customer demand or 
  printed in short runs to create stock in anticipation of demand. The publisher 
  can also contract with an external POD supplier such as Lighting Source to &#147;drop 
  ship&#148; an order that the publisher receives.</p>
					<p>A more common approach utilized by many university 
  presses, which tend to have a large number of slow moving titles, is to use 
  the services of a POD printer to do short runs to restock the shelves of their 
  warehouse. This has many advantages including a seamless integration with the 
  current ordering process &#151; after all it <i>uses</i> the current process. It 
  also minimizes the amount of freight paid since books will generally move in 
  larger quantities this way and it eliminates any negotiation issues around title 
  pricing or discount and retail discrimination against POD titles. The sole disadvantage 
  is the cost of carrying the inventory &#151; something that should have been addressed 
  in the printing decision to begin with.</p>
					<h3>Other Supply Chain Issues</h3>
					<p>The existing pBook supply chain moves hardcopies of books from printers to publishers to wholesalers to retailers to consumers and then between consumer as pass-along copies. Naturally they can also skip steps, go backward as returns, and move sideways in the channel as needed. Although the supply chain is usually envisioned as a single linkage between steps, each link is actually multiple transactions. A credit sale, in fact, can consist of as many as six transactions, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Issuing a purchase order</li>
						<li>Generating an ASN</li>
						<li>Shipping the book</li>
						<li>Invoicing for the book</li>
						<li>Generating a payment</li>
						<li>Generating a remittance advice</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These are then joined by various reconciling activities including receiving of the shipment and a 3-way match before issuing payment on the receiving end and cash application on the part of the shipper. This same series of transactions is repeated all the way down the line to the (finally!) simpler cash sale made by the retailer to the consumer.</p>
					<p>And this doesn't even take into account the whole picture. Between the publisher and wholesaler and between the wholesaler and retailer there is also a returns transaction loop that encompasses a variety of transactions. In a well-mannered returns environment there are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Return authorization requests</li>
						<li>Return authorizations</li>
						<li>Return shipments</li>
						<li>Credit memos</li>
					</ul>
					<p>More often than not, though, large retailers tends to dispense with the returns authorization process and substitutes a deduction from the payment as the first transaction in the returns process.</p>
					<p>All of these transactions lead to considerable cost. Beyond the transportation costs that are incurred with every move - either forward or backward - there are huge overhead costs involved in processing all of these transactions.</p>
					<p>POD done at a publisher eliminates the transactions between the printer 
        and publisher - but don't offer significant reduction in overall processing 
        load. It is really when POD is done at a wholesaler that the picture at 
        the upper end of the supply chain is significantly altered: there is no 
        longer a connection between the publisher and printer (although strictly 
        they are still there - they're just handled now by the wholesaler), and 
        between the wholesaler and publisher there is only the reporting of sales 
        and receipt and application of cash payments. Even COGS and inventory 
        accounting is simplified (presuming the publisher's systems are up to 
        the task!). The essence of this is that from an accounting perspective 
        the transaction looks more like self-reported subrights income than a 
        traditional book sale. Essentially we're turning a credit sale into a 
        cash sale or even a consignment sale with no inventory at risk.</p>
					<p>If wholesaler-based POD simplifies life for the publisher, the in-store 
        model simplifies the entire supply chain. In the in-store POD supply chain 
        the files can reside anywhere, but most likely at an off-site repository. 
        The purchase by the consumer initiates a substantially reduced chain of 
        linked transactions that results in sales reports and payments flowing 
        back up the chain with vastly reduced overhead.</p>
					<h3>Implications for POD</h3>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Publisher</i>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>Publishers will find POD valuable on many fronts. 
  There are several categories of work that are natural candidates for POD, most 
  prominently galleys, ARCs, and end-of-lifecycle or slow-moving titles. As the 
  decision to move titles into POD becomes an integral part of the reprint/OP/OSI 
  decision and happen as a matter of course, a publisher is increasingly likely 
  to have sufficient volume to justify investment (either in-house or outsourced) 
  in POD.</p>
					<p>In moving to POD the publisher has to choose 
  among three co-existing scenarios for using it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Should POD be done in-house or outsourced?</li>
						<li>Should POD be used to replenish stock or to fulfill 
    demand as it arrives?</li>
						<li>Should POD capability be moved down the supply 
    chain to distributors or retailers or should it remain within the publisher's 
    own control?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In-house or outsourced production is almost 
  entirely a matter of scale and business focus. As the number of titles a publisher 
  places in POD increases, it becomes increasingly reasonable to move production 
  inside. The savings in freight and manufacturing margin must be balanced against 
  the cost of setting up and operating the facility. Even if it makes sense from 
  an economic perspective, the cost to business focus must also be assessed.</p>
					<p>Make-to-stock versus make-to-order balances 
  the economics of holding inventory versus fulfilling to demand. The systems 
  and business disruption cost of integrating a POD operation into the normal 
  operation of a distribution center must also be considered. If there is sufficient 
  title base it is likely that make-to-order will gradually be started on an opportunistic 
  basis from a stable volume platform of print-to-stock.</p>
					<p>The choice as to whether to address POD at the level of the publisher 
        or push it down the supply chain will be influenced by channel discount 
        structure, the source of the majority of orders, extra manufacturing margin 
        paid versus what it would cost to handle the printing internally and the 
        amount of control exerted over the content downstream. A small publisher 
        that gets the majority of his orders through direct contact on his web 
        site or through direct mail might reasonably opt for a <a href="#dropship">drop 
        ship</a> fulfillment model (see next section), while one that gets the 
        bulk of orders through a large wholesaler such as Ingram or Baker &amp; 
        Taylor might opt for a <a href="#distributionmodel">distribution model</a> 
        (see next section). The publisher's objective is to get maximum distribution 
        and he shouldn't make decisions that will compromise that goal.</p>
					<p>Finally, it is likely that the very largest 
  publishers with global reach will need to place printing operations internationally 
  to increase service and reduce freight. It is likely that these publishers will 
  utilize a variety of outsourced suppliers to handle this printing until volume 
  internationally is large enough in a particular country or region to justify 
  their own operation.</p>
					<p>Publishers are likely to start with outsourced 
  POD to replenish stock (short run model). They will move to dedicated in-house 
  production operated by printers as scale develops. They will then begin to print 
  to demand opportunistically as the title base expands, although they are unlikely 
  to end up with a substantial amount of single unit printing in even the mid-term.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Wholesaler</i>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>Wholesalers have less demand for any particular title than publishers do. If 
  they can justify printing to stock, it's only on a limited basis. Most of the 
  printing by wholesalers will be done on-demand in units of one. Here printing 
  <i>should</i> be done in response to demand or, once the number of POD titles 
  gets large, the operation will pay a very high price in terms of inventory investment 
  and wholesalers have less margin on each sale to cover those costs than publishers 
  do.</p>
					<p>There are three popular models for wholesalers including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Short run. The short run model is used by publishers to replenish 
          their own warehous stock, using the wholesaler as a printer. Manufacting 
          and shipping is charged.</li>
						<li>
							<a name="dropship">Drop ship</a>. The drop ship model is when books 
          are printed on demand and shipped to destinations specified by either 
          the publisher or retailer. Manufaturing and shipping are paid but the 
          book ends up with the customer versus in the publisher's warehouse. 
          This is basically a direct sales fulfillment model.</li>
						<li>
							<a name="distributionmodel">Distribution model</a> &#151; The distribution 
          model is simply allowing orders that come in through a wholesaler to 
          be printed and fulfilled through that wholesaler. Since the publisher 
          is using the wholesaler <i>as</i> a wholesaler, a wholesale margin will 
          be paid along with the manufcturing cost of the book. Generally no freight 
          is charged. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>The last two of these models require a significant 
  title base and to be linked into a substantial order stream to be practical. 
  Consequently the size of the wholesaler is very important &#151; it is no accident 
  that the very largest wholesaler in the world was the first to experiment with 
  this concept.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Retailer</i>
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>Both the publisher and wholesale environments 
  are candidates for POD of a more central variety. To the extent that a retailer 
  is large enough to resemble either, a central POD operation can also be justified. 
  The retail store environment, however, is clearly the most difficult environment 
  in which to pursue POD today. Retail locations have the lowest demand of all 
  for any particular title &#151; except for the very hottest bestsellers, demand at 
  a retail location for any particular title is purely statistical &#151; most books 
  sell too slowly to actually have a valid &#147;rate of sale&#148; at any retail location. 
  This, by the way, is the cause of the terrible inventory turns seen at most 
  booksellers.</p>
					<p>In a retail location printing <i>must</i> be done exclusively in response to 
  demand or there will be a very large inventory price to pay. The title base 
  today is not adequate to generate a high probability of a customer finding any 
  particular title he may be seeking. One large retail chain that was interested 
  in piloting in-store POD was considering addressing this problem by making the 
  POD title a novelty item, allowing the customer to personalize a book by adding 
  a dedication, photos, etc. to any number of available public domain titles. 
  Ultimately the decision was that there were plenty of attractive pre-printed 
  and leather-bound books, calendars, and other items available so that the personalized 
  POD books would end up being seen as an extraneous item and neither drive sales 
  nor contribute to the environment of the store. The idea was temporarily shelved.</p>
					<p>Service issues predominate at the retail level including the time that a customer 
  must wait for the book to print and how well the experience of ordering and 
  waiting is integrated into the retail shopping experience. There is a somewhat 
  hackneyed suggestion that the consumer could be  &#147;getting a cup of coffee while 
  the book prints&#148;, but this is not the usual customer experience of shopping 
  for books. Further, as the number of customers seeking to print books at the 
  same time increases, one cup of coffee can easily turn into three or more and 
  the experience begins to disappoint.</p>
					<p>
						<b>How about the printer?</b>
					</p>
					<p>At printers there is a traditional mindset 
  on make-ready that is very difficult to overcome. This mindset is heavily oriented 
  toward cost-control and generating print runs of significant length to gain 
  economies of scale. In order to overcome the need for these long print runs, 
  technology must be implemented that reduces the fixed costs of taking, setting 
  up for, printing and delivering an order to practically nothing and then requires 
  shifting from a &#147;job shop&#148; to an &#147;assembly line&#148; (or flow-shop) approach to 
  production.</p>
					<p>The economics also work against a printer &#151; when a retailer, wholesaler, or 
  publisher utilizes POD they have access to margin from pricing and selling of 
  the title that a printer does not<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">
							<span>

						</a> &#151; creating an easier ability to pay for the installation and 
  operation of equipment.</p>
					<p>Printers do, however, have the skill to operate 
  print-on-demand in a high quality and effective manner &#151; something that is hard 
  to develop and maintain in a publishing, wholesaling or retail environment. 
  One retail chain for example was seriously considering having printing personnel 
  available for picking orders and helping on the shipping dock during peak seasons, 
  neglecting the differences in skill and cost and the ability to attract trained 
  printing personnel. Probably the best way for a printer to operate is to manage 
  outsourced operations for publishers or distributors either on-site in the publisher's 
  location or off-site via drop-ship.</p>
					<h3>Conclusion:  everyone benefits</h3>
					<p>Print-on-demand has a very beneficial effect on participants at all stages 
  of the supply chain. Publishers are realizing that they're missing sales and 
  having to revert rights because books are going out of print &#151; this needn't 
  be so. Wholesalers are realizing that they can be generating revenue streams 
  for themselves and their publishers through increased assortment without paying 
  the inventory price to do it. Large retailers are implementing warehouse-based 
  POD (similar to wholesalers) and with increasing title base and focus on the 
  <i>right</i> titles, in-store POD is growing ever more practical. There are 
  even models developing that are a hybrid of all of the above approaches, for 
  example &#147;network POD&#148; in which printing operations of varying sizes are linked 
  with distributed repositories and distributed catalogs. Acceptance of POD business 
  models is growing at all levels of the existing book supply chain and will only 
  increase over time.</p>

							</a> 50,000 units per month from 20,000 
    titles is 2.5 units per title per month at a wholesaler that serves an active 
    retail base of 5,000 stores (Ingram has many more customers, but 5,000 is 
    the approximate number of booksellers in the U.S.). This same title count 
    would translate into unit sales through one of these 5,000 stores of 10 units 
    per month on average (50,000 units /5,000 stores = 10 units). To get to a 
    target average output of 150 units per month would therefore require an equivalent 
    title base of 300,000 titles (20,000 current title multiplied by a growth 
    factor of 15)</p>

							</a> For example on sales of 100,000 units 
    per month at a cover price of $20 per book, wholesale discount of 50%, retail 
    discount of 35%, manufacturing price of $4.80 and manufacturing cost of $3.30, 
    a wholesaler would make $300,000 gross profit (with no inventory investment). 
    The supplying printer would make only $150,000 on the same volume. The greater 
    the spread between retail and wholesale discount, the greater the benefit 
    to the wholesaler.</p>
