               <p>Good morning. Today I'm going to discuss XML as it is in use in publishing, particularly trade book publishing, today. By
                  the time we're finished, I think you'll see that XML offers a pretty significant opportunity for revenue enhancement and cost
                  savings in most aspects of your business. 
               </p>
               			
               <p>Specifically, we're going to get into three main topics:</p>
               			
               <ul>

               <p>Reading platforms consist of combinations of hardware, operating system and reader applications.  An example of a platform
                  would be a Windows PC running Adobe Digital Editions, Mobipocket or the Microsoft reader (that's 3 separate platforms) or
                  a PocketPC PDA running either the Microsoft Reader or  eReader. A final example before we move on would be the Gemstar platform
                  consisting of device and reading application or Franklin eBookman also running its own application.

               <p>XML is really the key to get there </p>
               			
               <p>Once you have your content and metadata expressed in a rich markup, it's relatively easy to move it into other formats --
                  including other dialects of XML.
               </p>
               			
               <h2>Introduce XSL </h2>
               			
               <p>Tools are more prevalent, some being not terribly expensive and quite useful -- primarily I'm talking about XMLSpy which is
                  available under $200 per copy Many publishers are beginning to adopt XML for a variety of applications -- both archival and
                  presentation. Higher ed and STM publishers have used XML (or SGML) for a long time to archive their materials.  Trade publishers
                  are really just now getting into it with OEB.
               </p>
               			
               <p>Finally, nothing proves the point better than the number of applications that are out there in actual use.  XML is becoming
                  a serious transaction management standard to rival EDI -- witness Microsoft BizTalk.  OEB and other XML DTDs, along with XSL,
                  are being used at many publishers to generate multiple title formats, and a newer standard, ONIX, is being used to govern
                  the exchange of title metadata between publishers and their retailers. 
               </p>
               			
               <p>So now we've seen that XML offers a solution, let's get into some more detail on XML as it is used in content markup.  The
                  first thing to realize is that books are really 3 separate things rolled together.

               <p>The key is to realize that you have three separate elements to contend with:  content, structure and design. Each of these
                  have processes associated with them. These are also offset in time from each other.  Structuring usually starts first as the
                  author and editor work out the outline.  Then comes content development and finally design. 
               </p>
               			
               <p>I'm about to make the leap into preparing OEB-based eBooks, but before I do I'd like to introduce you to a key concept that
                  most folks readily appreciate even if they weren't aware of it explicitly:  from a content and design perspective books consist
                  of 3 main elements...

                  <li>Structure -- DTDs or Schemas at the highest level or specific BOMs at the title level. The components that a particular title
                     is made up of -- which might not even exist until call for (configuration-on-the-fly)

               </ul>
               			
               <p>All must be tied together with a common tag set -- the structure of a book </p>

               <p>Re-purposing cuts across each component and involves extraction of each of the three elements.  This is the role of the many
                  conversion vendors out there, including Publishing Dimensions, that specialize in such processes. 
               </p>
               			
               <p>These development processes flow into three "virtual" databases -- probably contained within the same document management
                  system.  To get final output the content then comes together with format-specific designs, usually contained in XSL and CSS
                  stylesheets, in a composition/rendering process. 
               </p>
               			
               <p>At a high level these feed the three major branches of ePublishing:  print-on-demand, eBooks, and on-line access. There's
                  clearly much more to this than this high-level diagram, but it's a good way to think of the overall process.

                  <p>I'm illustrating this process with this very straightforward, indeed boring, flow chart.  You start with an archived, high-resolution
                     PDF generally with crop marks and possibly split into chapters or forms.  You put them all together with Acrobat or one of
                     its plug-ins, then optimize the PDF by cropping to final trim, distilling using the eBook settings suggested by Adobe, setting
                     page numbers and linking the Table of Contents. All of this is done in Acrobat.  You can also generate bookmarks, thumbnails
                     and the like within Acrobat, as well. You then attach a cover image to the title -- created very easily in Photoshop -- and
                     you're done! 
                  </p>
                  				
                  <p>As reflowable PDF-based eBooks become popular, I imagine that we'll probably add some more tagging in here, but the accessibility
                     tools offered through Acrobat 5.0 look likely to provide some help there.

                  <p>It requires only that you "print" the PDFs first -- something that's becoming quite natural for anyone to do.  You just have
                     to make sure that you have *all* of the files before you begin.  Preflighting software helps a great deal with this.

                  <p>The main trick in converting PDFs to OEB-based eBooks is the extraction of the content, design and structure from the PDF.
                     Remember you're extracting content, structure and design so as to match the final output as closely as possible to the original.
                     There aren't very many good tools for this, although the accessibility plug-ins for Acrobat 5.0 are starting to get there.
                     Texterity is making some progress here as are others out there, but this process still requires manual intervention.  The
                     main issues that I've seen are removing hyphens, dealing with strange fonts and undoing all of the tricks that designers used
                     to make an attractive page.  Also there are some books that defy creation of OEB representations just due to their sheer complexity
                     -- there are many textbooks like this.  Coming out of this extraction process you'll end up with XML -- usually OEB, and some
                     sort of style sheet. 
                  </p>
                  				
                  <p>The next stage of the process is something I call "transcoding" mostly because I like the sound of the word.  This is where
                     you generate all of the different output formats and style them so that they look as close to the original as possible. These
                     days if you store your intermediate format as some sort of XML, you'll likely use some sort of XSLT translations of the style
                     sheets derived in the previous step.  Coming out of this step you'll end up with the various formats that will display on
                     the readers. 
                  </p>
                  				
                  <p>From all of this I'd like you to remember these two forks of the process -- one to PDF eBooks and the other to OEB eBooks.
                     BTW, the PDF editions can also be used for POD, although you would more than likely use different settings in distilling the
                     archive formats.

                  <img alt="Hardcopy to POD" src=""></img>
                  				
                  <p>We start this process by debinding the book, going through a scanning and image editing process to take out skew and speckles
                     and end up with clean page images.  BTW, this isn't necessarily as easy as it sounds.  I remember one vendor I was working
                     with that had the tolerances on his "speckles" set a little to high.  The program went right in and took out all of the periods
                     and dots on the "i"s -- it was most entertaining fixing that one! 
                  </p>
                  				
                  <p>The images are then slotted into a PDF template that positions them correctly for printing on a digital press such as at LSI,

                  <p>I've listed the 5 paths you can take up here as "type of conversion" You'll see that I've split them into rough families that
                     align with the flow charts I went through earlier -- the electronic family (from electronic files) and the hardcopy family
                     (from bound books).  I've also put up here what part of a publishers list is affected (frontlist or backlist), and most critically,
                     what the breakeven volume is:  the cost at which the gross margin from units sold pays for the cost of conversion.  To get
                     this I took conversion costs that are widely available in the industry and banged them up against a calculated Gross Margin
                     per book. This GM included pricing with any required adjustments, discounts to the channel participants -- I'm assuming retail
                     distribution so there's a big hit there, cost of manufacturing if relevant, and cost of royalties to authors.
                  </p>
                  				
                  <p>The final column is the incremental breakeven -- that is if you take the previous step, what is the incremental units you'll
                     have to sell to recover the extra cost of conversion.  For example if we're in the electronic conversion family, and we've
                     gone ahead and done the Acrobat eBook Reader format, how many more units would we have to sell to recover the cost of getting
                     to the next version -- say the Palm or Microsoft edition.  The answer here is only 12 more units.  For most books, I'd do
                     this in a flash. 
                  </p>
                  				
                  <p>Let me go through what I see are the main conclusions here: </p>
                  				
                  <ul>
                     					
                     <li>First notice that these breakevens aren't too high to begin with.  The main point is if you have the book, you might as well
                        get it into eBook and/or POD formats. 
                     </li>
                     					
                     <li>As you would expect for eBooks, it's much better to be working from electronic files. </li>
                     					
                     <li>As long as you're not competing with previously printed editions, it also seems like a slam-dunk to put all of your slow-moving
                        titles into POD.  The market is definitely there and you'll most likely sell far more than your breakeven

               <p>I think you'll agree that XML is becoming a major tool in cost control, in substantially increasing the breadth of offerings
                  a publisher can provide and in substantially reducing time to market.
